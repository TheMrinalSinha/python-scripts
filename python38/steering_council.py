# ==== THE PYTHON STEERING COUNCIL ====
# =====================================

# Technically, Pythonâ€™s governance is not a language feature. However, Python 3.8 is
# the first version of Python not developed under the benevolent dictatorship of
# Guido van Rossum. The Python language is now governed by a steering council
# consisting of five core developers:
#       -> Barry Warsaw
#       -> Brett Cannon
#       -> Carol Willing
#       -> Guido van Rossum
#       -> Nick Coghlan
