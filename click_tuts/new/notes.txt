# click is a python package for creating command line interfaces in
# a composable way with as little code as necessary.

# Click in 3 points:
# -> Arbitrary nesting of commands
# -> Automatic help page generation
# -> supports lazy loading of subcommands at runtime

click supports two types of parameters for scripts: options and arguments
Difference:
Auguments can do less than options. The following features are only available
for options.
-> automatic prompting for missing input
-> act as flags (boolean or otherwise)
-> option values can be pulled from environment variables, arguments can not.
-> options are fully documented in the help page, arguments are not (this is
intentional as arguments might be too specific to be automatically documented)
